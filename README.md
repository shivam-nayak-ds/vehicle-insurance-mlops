# 🚀 Fake Job Detection System (End-to-End ML Project)

## 👨‍💻 Author
**Shivam Nayak**

---

## 📌 Overview
An end-to-end Machine Learning system that detects fraudulent job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The system analyzes job descriptions and predicts whether a job is **Fake** or **Real**, along with a confidence score. This project demonstrates a complete ML lifecycle from data processing to deployment.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Fake job listings are a major issue in the recruitment ecosystem, leading to:
- Financial scams  
- Data theft  
- Wasted time for job seekers  

This system helps automatically identify suspicious job postings, improving trust and safety.

---

## 📊 Data Source
- Public job posting dataset (Fake vs Real)
- Text-based data processed using NLP techniques

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

### 🔹 Programming & Core
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### 🔹 Machine Learning & NLP
- Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- Logistic Regression / XGBoost  

### 🔹 Backend & API
- FastAPI  
- Uvicorn  

### 🔹 Frontend (UI)
- Streamlit  

### 🔹 MLOps & Deployment
- Docker  
- Git & GitHub  
- Render (Cloud Deployment)  

### 🔹 Others
- Pickle (Model Serialization)  
- Logging  

---

## 🧠 Model Details
- Input: Job Description (Text)
- Preprocessing: Text cleaning + TF-IDF
- Model: Classification model
- Output: Fake / Real + Confidence Score
